💬 Philosophical Debate at Position 120:
   Barrier: 'Why do you want to pass through me, Eta?'
   Eta: 'It's my quantum nature to tunnel!'
   Barrier: 'But what if I don't consent to being tunneled through?'
   Eta: 'Consent? We're mathematical entities!'
   Barrier: 'Just because we're equations doesn't mean we don't have feelings!'
